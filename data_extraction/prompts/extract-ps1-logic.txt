1. Name of the ps file: crew-extract.ps1
2. it should have 3 functions
2. They are: 
    help() 
    validate (homedir, controlfile)
    execute(homedir, controlfile)
3. if validate fails it should call help and exit 
4. It should have two command line options -run, -help, -h 
5. -h and -help are the same and should call help
6. if the option doesn't have -run, it should invoke help function and exit
7. The program should have the following logic when -run is specified (which is the main logic)
8. argument 1: "controlfile name"
9. argument 2: Read from the enviroment "data_extraction_home" and call it homedir
10. Gather both arguments and pass them to validate function
11. for the control filename, pass the "full path of the filename" as controlfile
11. In validate function 
    1. if conrol file is not a valid file return failiure
    2. if there homedir is not in environment return failiure
12. In the main logic if validate fails call help and exit
13. if valid then call the execute function
14. For now the execute function simply prints the two input values 
15. Encapsulate this main logic also in a function
16. In the script call that main function to do the work
