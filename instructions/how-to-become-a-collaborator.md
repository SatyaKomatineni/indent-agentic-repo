<!-- ********************* -->

1. Go to the repo in github
2. Choose "Settings" on top menu (right)
3. Locate "Manage Access"

This will send an email to the github user that was added. When accepted, that user will show up as collaborator in the list. Till that time it will show as "pending invite".
