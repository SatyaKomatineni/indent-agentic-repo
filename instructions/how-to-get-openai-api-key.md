# OpenAI API Setup

## Goal
I am a **paid personal user** who wants to:

1. Use the API for **learning and experimentation** from Python apps.
2. Understand **how to create an API** for such purposes (as briefly as possible).
3. Learn the **necessary options** while creating the API.
4. Identify a **cheap model for experimenting with Agentic AI**.
5. Know **where to monitor the usage of the API once in operation**.


## How to Create an API Key (Briefly)
1. Log in to [OpenAIâ€™s platform](https://platform.openai.com).
2. Navigate to **API Keys** under [account settings](https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys).
3. Click **"Create secret key"** and store it securely.

## Necessary Options While Creating the API Key
- Use the **default project** (sufficient for single-user experiments).
- Set **rate limits** in [Billing Limits](https://platform.openai.com/account/billing/limits) to control costs.
- Choose **personal API keys** instead of service accounts.
- Set **permissions** for the API key: **All** (Full control over API access and settings).

## Cheapest Model for Agentic AI Experimentation
- **GPT-3.5 Turbo** is the most cost-effective option for agentic AI experiments.
- **GPT-4-Turbo** is available for more advanced reasoning but costs more.

## Where to Monitor API Usage
- Track API usage and costs at [Usage Dashboard](https://platform.openai.com/account/usage).
- Set **spending alerts and limits** in the billing section.
