In corporate news, Apple's (AAPL) delay in releasing advanced Siri capabilities means the company will have fewer features to encourage iPhone upgrades in fiscal 2026, eventually leading to a slower replacement cycle for iPhones, Morgan Stanley said in a Wednesday note. Morgan Stanley cut Apple's price target to $252 from $275 while keeping its overweight rating. Apple shares were down 2.4%.
