A delay in the rollout of an update to Apple's Siri assistant has prompted Citi analysts to forecast a more modest growth in iPhone sales.

Atif Malik and his team at Citi now expect Apple to sell 232 million iPhones in the calendar year 2025, or a 2% growth from the prior year, down from an earlier estimate of 5%.

The lower estimate comes after Apple last week delayed promised artificial intelligence updates to Siri, saying it expects to roll "them out in the coming year." While no exact timeline was given by Apple, the company was expected to roll out the new and improved voice assistant in April or May alongside the release of the iOS 18.4 software update.

Apple has said the new Siri would be able to tap into a user's personal information to answer queries and take action across the apps.

"Given the delays in the highly anticipated major Siri update, we believe Apple will miss the opportunity to drive up refreshment cycle this year," Malik wrote. Citi kept its Buy rating on the stock and price target of $275 unchanged.

The iPhone makes up the majority of Apple's revenue. For the fiscal year 2024 that ended in September, Apple sold 4.4% fewer iPhone units compared to the prior year, according to FactSet.

Apple stock dipped 1.2% to $236.11 in early Monday trading.
