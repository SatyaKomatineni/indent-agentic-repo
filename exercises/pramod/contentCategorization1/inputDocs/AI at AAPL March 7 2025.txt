Apple said it is delaying an upgrade to Siri that is enhanced by artificial intelligence.

The company, which has faced slumping iPhone sales in recent months, on Friday said that it would take it longer than expected to make Siri more personalized and make it able to take action for the user within and across apps.

"It's going to take us longer than we thought to deliver on these features and we anticipate rolling them out in the coming year," the company said.

The delay follows recent efforts from Apple to make Siri more conversational, and an integration with OpenAI's ChatGPT, the company said.

In September, Apple unveiled a new generation of iPhones that put AI at the forefront to attract consumers through new AI features.

These tools, called "Apple Intelligence," were set to include an improved Siri voice assistant and a variety of text- generation and photo-editing capabilities.

The Cupertino, Calif., company most recently reported iPhone sales for the key December quarter were down nearly 1% from the prior year, to $69.1 billion, a miss from the $70.7 billion analysts were projecting, according to FactSet.
