Apple is still looking for the change that will spur hardware sales. A significant redesign of the software on its devices could be part of the solution.

Apple is planning significant changes to the interfaces of the iPhone, iPad and Mac later this year, making their software platforms more consistent and simplifying how they are used, Bloomberg reported, citing people familiar with the project.

Apple didn't immediately respond to a request for comment on the report early on Tuesday.

If there is a significant design update, it will likely be announced at Apple's Worldwide Developers Conference, which typically happens in June. The company hasn't announced a date for the annual event yet.

With Apple recently delaying promised artificial-intelligence updates to its Siri virtual assistant, the company is under pressure to find a way to entice consumers to update their devices. Sales of iPhones are likely to have dropped to 224 million units last year from 231 million in 2023, according to FactSet.

"The good news is that AI is not yet needed to sell iPhones giving Apple time to sort the mess out, but this does give Google an opportunity to take the fight to Apple," wrote independent analyst Richard Windsor, who publishes Radio Free Mobile, on Tuesday.
